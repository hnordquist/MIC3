To update your MIC installation:
1) Stop MIC
2) Open up the zip file 2013-08-02.zip (on the CD under collect/MIC)
3) Repace the files MICDump.exe and MICMgr.exe in your MIC installation folder 
   (likely C:\MIC), with the newer files of the same name in the zip package.
4) Restart MIC. MIC's version number in the title bar shoud be 2.0.0.9.
5) Verify the update by running MICDump and noting the version # 1.1.0.0 
   and by finding the 'Serial Port List...' menu item entry on MIC's main menu.
